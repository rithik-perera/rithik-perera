## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
1. [python-CW](https://github.com/rithik-perera/Python-CW) - Created a Python program tailored to university scenarios successfully.This program takes input data, including a student's credits, and produces a result indicating whether the studentcan progress, needs to repeat a course, or should follow a module trailer. Skills used: python.

2. [ClinetServerArchitectureAPICreation](https://github.com/rithik-perera/clientServerArchitectureAPICreation) -contains the basic CRUD operations for a hospital management system containing model, DAO and resource classes. For now this repo only consists of the java files without the pom files and the necessary dependencies.

3. [OOP-Coursework](https://github.com/rithik-perera/OOP-Coursework) -  The Shopping Management System, built in Java, utilizes OOP
principles to efficiently manage products. Its console menu, structured with classes like Product and User,ensures seamless interactions. Additionally, the system features a user-friendly GUI developed in Java Swing, enhancing the shopping experience with a user-friendly interface.
   
5. [TrekTango-SDGP](https://github.com/dilmi214/TrekTango-SDGP) -  As the project leader in a software development group, myresponsibilities included distributing workload and task assignments. In addition to this, I was responsible for
contributing to the back-end development and the creation of the CRUD operations. Our project focused ondeveloping a mobile travelling game application using Node.js and React Native. This app incentivised users with points for visiting various locations, fostering engagement and exploration.

6. [AlgorithmCoursework](https://github.com/rithik-perera/AlgorithmCoursework) - This project tackles a pathfinding challenge commonly encountered in video games using Java. Leveraging the A* algorithm, it provides a solution to navigate a character through a grid-based map filled with frictionless ice and obstacles, aiming to reach a designated endpoint from a starting position.
